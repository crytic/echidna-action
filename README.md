# Echidna action

This action allows you to run `echidna-test` from within a GitHub Actions
workflow. The action builds on the `trailofbits/echidna` Docker image, adding
`solc-select` and providing a simpler way to execute Echidna as part of an
Actions workflow.

## Inputs

| Key                  | Description
|----------------------|------------
| `files`              | **Required** Solidity files or folders to analyze.
| `contract`           | Contract to analyze.
| `config`             | Config file (CLI arguments override config options).
| `format`             | Output format: json, text, none. Disables interactive UI.
| `corpus-dir`         | Directory to store corpus and coverage data.
| `test-mode`          | Type of tests to be performed: property, assertion, overflow, optimization, exploration.
| `multi-abi`          | Use multi-abi mode of testing.
| `test-limit`         | Number of sequences of transactions to generate during testing.
| `rpc-block`          | Block number to use when fetching over RPC.
| `rpc-url`            | Fetch contracts over a RPC URL.
| `shrink-limit`       | Number of tries to attempt to shrink a failing sequence of transactions.
| `seq-len`            | Number of transactions to generate during testing.
| `contract-addr`      | Address to deploy the contract to test.
| `deployer`           | Address of the deployer of the contract to test.
| `sender`             | Addresses to use for the transactions sent during testing.
| `seed`               | Run with a specific seed.
| `crytic-args`        | Additional arguments to use in crytic-compile for the compilation of the contract to test.
| `solc-args`          | Additional arguments to use in solc for the compilation of the contract to test.
| `solc-version`       | Version of the Solidity compiler to use.
| `output-file`        | Capture echidna-test's output into a file. The path must be relative to the repository root.
| `echidna-version`    | Version of the Echidna Docker image to use.
| `negate-exit-status` | Apply logical NOT to echidna-test's exit status (for testing the action).
| `echidna-workdir`    | Path to run echidna-test from. Note that `files` and `config` are relative to this path.

## Outputs

| Key           | Description
|---------------|------------
| `output-file` | If produced, the file containing echidna-test's output, relative to the repository root.

## Examples

### Basic usage

```yaml
uses: crytic/echidna-action@v2
with:
  files: contracts/
  contract: Marketplace
```

### Example workflow: Hardhat

The following is a complete GitHub Actions workflow example. It will trigger
with commits on `master` as well as any pull request opened against the `master`
branch. It will configure NodeJS 16.x on the runner, and then install project
dependencies (using `npm ci`). Once the environment is set up, it will build the
project (using `npx hardhat compile`) and finally run Echidna against a contract
called `TokenEchidna`. The workflow will fail if Echidna breaks any of the
invariants in `TokenEchidna`.

In this example, we are leveraging `crytic-args` to pass
`--hardhat-ignore-compile`. This skips building the project as part of the
Echidna action, and instead takes advantage of the already built contracts. This
is required, as the Echidna action environment does not have NodeJS available.

```yaml
name: Echidna Test

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Use Node.js 16
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: 16
        cache: 'npm'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Compile contracts
      run: npx hardhat compile
    - name: Run Echidna
      uses: crytic/echidna-action@v2
      with:
        solc-version: 0.7.6
        files: .
        contract: TokenEchidna
        crytic-args: --hardhat-ignore-compile
```

### Example workflow: Foundry

The following is a complete GitHub Actions workflow example. It will trigger
with commits on `main` as well as any pull request opened against the `main`
branch. It will install Foundry on the runner, and then it will build the
project (using `forge build --build-info`) and finally run Echidna against a
contract called `TokenEchidna`. The workflow will fail if Echidna breaks any of
the invariants in `TokenEchidna`.

In this example, we are leveraging `crytic-args` to pass `--ignore-compile`.
This skips building the project as part of the Echidna action, and instead takes
advantage of the already built contracts. This is required, as the Echidna
action environment does not have `forge` available.

```yaml
name: Echidna Test

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

env:
  FOUNDRY_PROFILE: ci

jobs:
  test:      
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
      with:
        submodules: recursive

    - name: Install Foundry
      uses: foundry-rs/foundry-toolchain@v1
      with:
        version: nightly

    - name: Compile contracts
      run: |
        forge build --build-info

    - name: Run Echidna
      uses: crytic/echidna-action@v2
      with:
        files: .
        contract: TokenEchidna
        crytic-args: --ignore-compile
```
